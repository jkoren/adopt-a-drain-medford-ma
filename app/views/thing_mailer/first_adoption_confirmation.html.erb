  <p>
    Dear <%= @user.name.split.first %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for adopting one of Medford’s catch basins/storm drains! By keeping this drain free of leaves and debris, you are joining your neighbors in helping to protect the Mystic River and Lakes, manage stormwater, and minimize flooding.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">How to Care For Your Adopted Drain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If possible, clear your drain before and after it rains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear about 10 feet around your drain, removing anything that could get swept in or clog the drain, including leaves, trash, and snow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dispose of trash or recyclables as you would normally, in their appropriate bins. Organic material like leaves and sticks can be disposed of with your yard waste. Visit <a href="http://www.medfordma.org/2019/12/17/2020-waste-management-trash-recycling-schedule/"> Medford’s trash and recycling page </a> if you have questions about how to dispose of debris.
    </li>
    <li>
      Medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Drain clogged below the grate? Report it using <a href="https://www.medfordma.org/seeclickfix/">SeeClickFix</a> or contact the Medford Department of Public Works at 781-393-2417.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">Drain Cleaning Safety Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Never try to lift the drain grate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear from the sidewalk, not the street.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wear reflective clothing so vehicles can see you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always wear gloves and be very careful of sharp objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a rake, broom, or shovel - not your hands.
    </li>
  </ul>
